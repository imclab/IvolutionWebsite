<p>Ivolution was created as a pet project, to help a friend currently travelling around the world.
It is still in early development, but pretty much already achieves what it was created for !</p>

<p>The important thing to note is that I can not be taken responsible for any problem you might encounter (but I'd be glad to help you solve them if you have some).
I never experienced any problem using Ivolution (nor all my users), but you are advised to make a copy of the images your are about to process first.</p>
<p>About me</p>
<p>My name is Julien Lengrand-Lambert, and I am as french software engineer currently living in the Netherlands.
You can learn more about me (and the development of Ivolution) on my website, or on my G+ page.</p>
<p>To follow my projects real time, you can also follow me on GitHub.</p>
<p>For Ivolution related matters, the official email address is ivolution.app@gmail.fr, but you can also mail me personally on ju.lien@leng.rand.fr (without the dots in julien and lengrand :)).</p>
<p>Acknowledgements</p>
<p>the following is a list of persons or ressources that helped me developing Ivolution :</p>
<ul>
<li>As a starter for the application, I used an excellent face detection example (http://japskua.wordpress.com/2010/08/04/detecting-eyes-with-python-opencv/) from Japskua.</li>
<li>I use Gene Cash's exif library (http://sourceforge.net/projects/exif-py/) to extract information from EXIF metadata contained in the images</li>
<li>The current logo of Ivolution comes from a picture by Luc Viatour (http://www.Lucnix.be) and taken from Wikipedia.</li>
<li>Ivolution was developed based on an original idea from Axel Catoire, who is currently travelling around the world (http://ungrandtour.blogspot.com/).</li>
