## Coz' 1 minute is faster than 5 minutes. . . here is a light speed fast tutorial


This page aims at putting you on rails __as fast as possible__, so that you can see what Ivolution is capable of by yourself __in less than 5 minutes__.

First of all, __[download](link to Download page)__ the version of Ivolution corresponding to your operating system here.
Then, __[download the set of samples](link to samples directly)__ that you are going to use here, and extract the archive where you want.

Install the Ivolution and run it.
You should now see the main frame of the application.


Click on the input folder, and select the location of the samples.
