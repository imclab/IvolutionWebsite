## Binaries and Code

Here is what you need to install Ivolution :

- For __Windows__ users, the last executable
- For __Linux and Mac__ users, the source package

- Complete source code of the last version (updated each time I commit)

Older versions are also available here:

- Windows
- Other

If you want to always have the last version available, you can also choose to directly clone the git repository of the project
(and I'll gladly accept your pull requests ! ;))

    :::python
    $ git clone .. .


Simply enter the project and run __./Ivolutioner__ in command line should get you started :).

## Other downloads

Several other ressources are available to download :

- Current documentation (html)
- Current documentation (pdf)

- pack of samples, to test the application.
