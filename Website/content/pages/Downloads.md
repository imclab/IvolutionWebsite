## Binaries and Code

Here is what you need to install Ivolution :

- For __Windows__ users, [the last executable](http://sourceforge.net/projects/ivolutioner/files/current/Ivolution_0.6.1.exe/download)
- For __Linux and Mac__ users, [the source package](http://sourceforge.net/projects/ivolutioner/files/current/Ivolution-0.6.zip/download)

- [Complete source code of the last version](https://github.com/jlengrand/Ivolution/zipball/master) (updated each time I commit)

Older versions are also available [here](https://sourceforge.net/projects/ivolutioner/files/older%20versions/).


If you want to always have the last version available, you can also choose to directly clone the git repository of the project
(and I'll gladly accept your pull requests ! ;))

    :::python
    $ git clone https://github.com/jlengrand/Ivolution.git


Simply enter the project and run __./Ivolutioner__ in command line should get you started :).
