Welcome on the webiste on the Ivolution project !

Ivolution is a face timelapse generator.
Feed it with a bunch of images and it will generate a movie with your face centered on the screen.

Here is a small demonstration of what Ivolution can achieve :

Ivolution uses face recognition and modifies the images so that your face always keeps the same size and location over the movie.
Images are processed in chronological order, so that you can see your face evoluate over time !

Ivolution currently supports Windows and Linux, and was successfully tested on Windows XP, 7 and Ubuntu 12.04.


Ivolution is currently still in early development, and you may face bugs or feel like critical features are missing.
In this case, just let me know by sending me a mail or by filing a bug here. I'll be glad to help you !
