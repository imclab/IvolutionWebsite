## Welcome on the website of the Ivolution project !


Ivolution is a __face timelapse generator__.
Feed it with a bunch of images and it will generate a movie with your face centered on the screen.

Here is a small demonstration of what Ivolution can achieve :

Ivolution uses __face detection__ and modifies the images so that your face always keeps the same size and location over the movie.
Images are processed in __chronological order__, so that you can see your face evoluate over time !

Ivolution uses a really simple interface, so that you timelapse is only two clicks from being generated !
Here is what the current interface looks like :

Ivolution currently supports Windows and Linux and was successfully tested on Windows XP, 7 and Ubuntu 12.04.


Ivolution is currently still in early development, and you may face bugs or feel like critical features are missing.
In this case, just let me know by [sending me a mail](ivolution_app@gmail.com) or by [filing a bug here](https://github.com/jlengrand/FaceMovie/issues?state=open). I'll be glad to help you !
