### Other informations

__Ivolution__ was created as a pet project, to help a friend currently [travelling around the world](http://ungrandtour.blogspot.nl/) (French inside).
It is still in early development, but pretty much already achieves what it was created for !

The important thing to note is that __I can not be taken responsible for any problem you might encounter__ (but I'd be glad to help you solve them if you have some).
I never experienced any problem using Ivolution (nor all my users), but you are advised to make a copy of the images your are about to process first.

### Acknowledgements

the following is a list of persons or ressources that helped me developing Ivolution :

- As a starter for the application, I used an [excellent face detection example](http://japskua.wordpress.com/2010/08/04/detecting-eyes-with-python-opencv/) from __Japskua__.
- I use __Gene Cash__'s [exif library](http://sourceforge.net/projects/exif-py/) to extract information from EXIF metadata contained in the images
- The current logo of Ivolution comes from a picture by __[Luc Viatour](http://www.Lucnix.be)__ and taken from Wikipedia.
- Ivolution was developed based on an original idea from __Axel Catoire__, who is currently [travelling around the world](http://ungrandtour.blogspot.com/).
